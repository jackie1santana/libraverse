# LibraVerse Project Setup Guide

A comprehensive, step-by-step guide to setting up the LibraVerse application, incorporating microservices architecture with Ruby, Python with Django, Angular, Golang, React Native, using Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, AWS Fargate for serverless computing, NGINX as an API Gateway, and CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment.

## Initial Setup

1. **Version Control Initialization**
   - Initialize a Git repository for each microservice and for the frontend application.
   - Create a `develop` branch for ongoing development work.

## Development of Microservices

2. **User Authentication Service (Ruby)**
   - Set up the Ruby environment and install Rails or Sinatra.
   - Develop the authentication functionality, incorporating JWT for secure token-based authentication.

3. **Book Management Service (Python with Django)**
   - Set up the Python environment and install Django along with the Django REST Framework.
   - Develop CRUD operations for managing books, including models, views, and serializers for RESTful API communication.

4. **Front-End Application (Angular)**
   - Install Node.js and the Angular CLI.
   - Develop the front-end application, implementing Angular Material for UI components and RxJS for reactive programming.

5. **AI Book Recognition Service (Golang)**
   - Set up the Go environment.
   - Develop the service to recognize books through camera images, utilizing TensorFlow Go or integrating with AWS Rekognition for image processing.

6. **Mobile Application (React Native)**
   - Set up the React Native environment.
   - Develop the mobile application, ensuring it can communicate with the backend services for authentication, book management, and AI recognition.

## Containerization with Docker

7. **Dockerize Each Service**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for each service and the front-end application.
   - Build Docker images and test them locally to ensure each service runs correctly within a container.

## Continuous Integration with CircleCI

8. **Set Up CircleCI**
   - Connect CircleCI to your GitHub repositories.
   - Create a `.circleci/config.yml` file in each repository, defining the pipeline for automated testing and building Docker images.

## Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

9. **Define Infrastructure with Terraform**
   - Write Terraform scripts to define your AWS infrastructure, including VPC, subnets, security groups, ECS or EKS (for Kubernetes), and RDS (if needed).

## Orchestration with Kubernetes

10. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**
    - Use Terraform to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in AWS EKS, considering integration with AWS Fargate for specific services.

11. **Deploy Microservices to Kubernetes**
    - Write Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files for each microservice and the front-end application.
    - Apply the configurations to deploy the services to the Kubernetes cluster.

## API Gateway Integration

12. **Configure NGINX as an API Gateway**
    - Set up NGINX to route requests to the appropriate microservices.
    - Configure SSL termination for HTTPS support.

## Continuous Deployment with CircleCI

13. **Automate Deployment in CircleCI**
    - Extend the `.circleci/config.yml` to include deployment steps that apply Kubernetes configurations.
    - Use CircleCI to automatically deploy new versions of your services to Kubernetes upon successful build and test.

## Final Steps

14. **Security and Testing**
    - Implement security best practices, including network policies in Kubernetes, secure secrets management, and regular security scanning.
    - Write extensive tests covering unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests for continuous testing in CircleCI.

15. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - Set up monitoring and logging solutions, such as Prometheus for monitoring and ELK Stack or AWS CloudWatch for logging, to ensure the health and performance of your services.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will set up the LibraVerse project with a robust development, testing, and deployment workflow, ensuring each component is scalable, secure, and maintainable. Continuous integration and deployment with CircleCI streamline the workflow, allowing for efficient development cycles and high-quality software delivery.
